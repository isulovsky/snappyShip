# snappyShip
automatic grid generation for ship calm water computations using snappyHexMesh and python script. This case study involves simple geometry for a parametric Wigley hull. Ship parameters are given in system/shipDict.
This automation procedures reduces turnaround time mostly in terms of creation of the kelvin wake geometry and anisotropic refinements.
